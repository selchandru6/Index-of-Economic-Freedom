# Index-of-Economic-Freedom
Created in 1995 by the Heritage Foundation, The Index of economic freedom, is a ranking created to measure the economic freedom in the countries of the world. Now, in its 25 th edition, The Economic Freedom Index is poised to help readers track over two decades of the advancement in economic freedom, prosperity, and opportunity and promote these ideas in their homes, schools, and communities. The Index covers 12 freedoms – from property rights to financial freedom – in 186 countries.
